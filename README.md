# Weather-Prediction

This repository contains code for predicting weather using machine learning algorithms. The project aims to predict weather patterns for a specific location by utilizing historical weather data, satellite images, and other relevant environmental data.

The main files included in this repository are:

- train_data.csv: A CSV file containing historical weather data for a specific location. This data includes temperature, humidity, precipitation, and other relevant weather parameters.


To use this code, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Install the required Python packages listed in requirements.txt by running pip install -r requirements.txt in your terminal.

Place your own historical weather data in weather_data.csv.


For more details on the implementation and methodology used in this project, please refer to the code comments and documentation.
